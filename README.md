This repository is for the completion of Programming Assignment 3b that invloved concepts and methods in Chapter 5 and 6 like  elimination methods and matrix properties and operations, and also Gaussian elimination and backward substitution for linear system of equations written in augmented matrix format, LU Factorization, matrix determinant, L matrix, U matrix, diagonally dominate, and positive definite. To run the code you need import numpy as np which is in the requirements.txt and I used a requirements.txt. I used python for this assignment for the code because we were told to use python and to run the code you really just need to copy the code and run it on the complier you are using. Some commands to run the code are import numpy as np, np.array, def gaussian_elimination(matrix):, def back_substitution(matrix):, def doolittle_lu_decomposition(A):, def is_diagonally_dominant(matrix):, def is_positive_definite(matrix):,
